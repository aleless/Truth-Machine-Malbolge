# Truth-Machine-Malbolge
A "Truth Machine" program written in Malbolge.  


This program demonstrates basic conditional logic in one of the world's most difficult esoteric programming languages.  

How it works:  
1. It reads a single character from standard input.  
2. If the input is '0', it prints '0' to standard output and halts.  
3. If the input is '1', it prints '1' to standard output repeatedly in an infinite loop (until externally terminated, e.g., with Ctrl+C).  
4. Behavior for other inputs is typically undefined or results in a quick halt.  

Like most non-trivial Malbolge programs, this code was likely discovered through computational search rather than direct human authorship. Its apparent gibberish nature is characteristic of Malbolge.
